TR will work w/ the default options in ctm_setup

ExtData2G is TRUE by default, using yaml files.
There are problems with using ExtData1G in this context, and no efforts
will be put towards backwards compatibility, so please use ExtData2G.
NOTE: 1G had the ability to regrid vertically (e.g. 44 pressure levels -> 72 eta levels),
but 2G cannot do this.

Only the MERRA2 met-fields are fully supported at this time.

The file 'extdata.yaml' is generated by $GEOSBIN/construct_extdata_yaml_list.py

Sections of the run-script are not needed, but they are kept
for the convenience of comparison with GCM.  They are skipped
by the addition of simple 'goto' statements.

ChemEnv imports a few fields that are not available in the CTM context, so
NULL imports are quietly added in the run-script; search the script for
'Until ChemEnv accounts for Imports'

GOCART includes the hard-coded filename "AGCM.rc" .
The run-script makes a link of that name; search for
'Until GOCART2G stops referring to AGCM.rc'

NOTE: EXTDATA_CF in CAP.rc only works for ExtData1G; it is kept
since it is part of the logic when running non-MERRA2 met fields.

GMI:
GMI needs imports RI and RL for CloudJ. It requests the imports
even when it doesn't need them, so we compensate with NULL entries;
search the run-script for 'Until GMI accounts for Imports'
A future release of GMI will handle RI and RL better.

GMI can supply aerosols; if this option is selected during setup,
optics filenames are appended to GEOSCTM.rc

GOCART
Currently when running the 'data' instances, DU and NI
are friendly to transport. This is a bug. Follow the instructions
at the top of this file to correct. Or apply GOCART PR #307.

TR
Don't run TR tracers at the same time as GMI; they will be problematic
because the GMI-specific convection will fail to find mw values.

HEMCO:
If GOCART2G is running, even if it's in DATA DRIVEN mode, HEMCO
still needs to be running the GOCART2G instance, because CHEM cannot tell
what mode GOCART2G is running in, so it adds a HEMCO->GOCART2G connectivity
whether it's needed or not.

Timestep-
Change the HEARTBEAT to 450 in CAP.rc, change *_DT to 450 in GEOSCTM.rc and
in MERRA2_ExtData.yaml.tmpl change PT15M to PT7M30S .
