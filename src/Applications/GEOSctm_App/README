As of Apr 10, 2025:

Requires modifications in these repo's:

  FVdycoreCubed_GridComp  (PR #301):
    pushd src/Components/GEOSctm_GridComp/@FVdycoreCubed_GridComp/
    git merge remotes/origin/feature/mmanyin/update_for_CTM
    popd

  GOCART :
    pushd src/Components/GEOSctm_GridComp/@GEOSchem_GridComp/@GOCART/
    git merge remotes/origin/feature/mmanyin/update_for_CTM
    popd

TR will work w/ the default options in ctm_setup

ExtData2G is TRUE by default, using yaml files.
GEOS-CTM still is able to run with the old rc files, but be advised
that they likely will not be kept up-to-date.

Only the MERRA2 met-fields are fully supported at this time.

The file 'extdata.yaml' is generated by $GEOSBIN/construct_extdata_yaml_list.py

Sections of the run-script are not needed, but they are kept
for the convenience of comparison with GCM.  They are skipped
by the addition of simple 'goto' statements.

ChemEnv runs the LOPEZ lightning scheme by default, and a few imports
that are available in the GCM context are not available from MERRA2.
For now we set ChemEnv to use the MOIST scheme instead.
The CHEM code still tries to import the missing fields, so
NULL imports are quietly added in the run-script; search for
'Until ChemEnv accounts for Imports'


GOCART includes the hard-coded filename "AGCM.rc" .
The run-script makes a link of that name; search for
'Until GOCART2G stops referring to AGCM.rc'

NOTE: EXTDATA_CF in CAP.rc only works for ExtData1G; it is kept
since it is part of the logic when running non-MERRA2 met fields.

GMI:
GMI needs imports RI and RL for CloudJ. It requests the imports
even when it doesn't need them, so we compensate with NULL entries;
search the run-script for 'Until GMI accounts for Imports'
We need to decide if/how to run CloudJ in CTM.

GOCART
Currently when running the 'data' instances, DU and NI
are friendly to transport. This is a bug.
TR tracers can still run, but GMI will flag a problem
because the GMI-specific convection will fail to find
mw values.  Apply GOCART PR #307 to fix.
GMI can supply aerosols; if this option is selected during setup,
optics filenames are appended to GEOSCTM.rc

HEMCO:
If GOCART2G is running, even if it's in DATA DRIVEN mode, HEMCO
still needs to be running the GOCART2G instance, because
CHEM adds a connectivity.
